That feeling of \"moving through mud\" is a very real, often hidden, part of many healing journeys.\n\nHealing isn't always about a sudden transformation or feeling \"fixed.\" Sometimes, it looks like small, gentle shifts: a flicker of peace, a moment of less judgment towards yourself, or finding a new way to cope with a difficult feeling. It's often non-linear, with ups and downs, and those muddy patches are just as much a part of the process as any clear path.\n\nFor today, perhaps focus on just one small act of kindness towards yourself. It could be noticing your breath for a few moments, or simply acknowledging how hard you're working right now. Be gentle with yourself as you navigate this; you're doing important work."
