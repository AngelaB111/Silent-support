I hear how incredibly heavy and confusing this \"persistent fog\" must feel, especially when there isn't a clear reason you can point to. It's truly understandable that not knowing the 'why' makes it feel even more perplexing, and that your energy and interest are impacted. Please know that these feelings are very real and valid, even without a specific event to explain them.\n\nIt takes a lot of strength to simply acknowledge where you're at. As you navigate this, try to offer yourself extra kindness and compassion. Perhaps you could try just one small, gentle act of comfort today—like a warm drink, listening to a favorite calming song, or simply allowing yourself a few moments of quiet rest.\n\nIf these feelings continue to be a significant struggle, reaching out to a mental health professional can offer you a supportive space to explore them further and discover personalized ways to navigate this period."
