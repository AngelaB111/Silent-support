That must be incredibly tough, and please know it's completely understandable to feel this way sometimes.\n\nWhen anxiety feels overwhelming, sometimes a simple grounding exercise can offer a moment of calm. Perhaps try to bring your attention to your breath for a minute or two: inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of two, and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel what you're feeling, and taking small steps to care for yourself can make a difference. I'm here to listen if you'd like to talk more."
