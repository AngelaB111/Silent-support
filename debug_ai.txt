It takes a lot of strength to acknowledge that.\n\nWhen those thoughts become too much, sometimes it can help to gently bring your attention to the present moment. Try focusing on a few things you can sense right now – maybe the feeling of your feet on the floor, the sound of your own breath, or something you can see in front of you. Take a few slow, deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth, allowing yourself to anchor a little.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself as you navigate these feelings. If this panic continues to feel overwhelming, reaching out to a mental health professional for more dedicated support can offer additional tools and comfort."
