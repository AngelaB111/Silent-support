Please know this is a safe space for you.\n\nPerhaps take a slow, gentle breath right now – just noticing it fill and leave your body. Sometimes, a simple moment of calm can make a difference.\n\nThere's no pressure, but if you feel like sharing more, I'm ready to hear it. Or, if you prefer, we can simply focus on that breath for a little while longer."
