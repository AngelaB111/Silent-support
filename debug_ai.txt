That's a really challenging and often overwhelming feeling to experience, and it's completely okay to feel that way.\n\nWhen anxiety feels overwhelming, sometimes focusing on your breath can offer a small anchor. Could you try placing a hand on your stomach and taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose, feeling your stomach rise, then exhaling slowly through your mouth? Repeat that a few times, gently bringing your attention to the sensation of your breath.\n\nRemember to be kind and patient with yourself in this moment. Even small acts of self-care can make a difference."
